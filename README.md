# CSE569-lab3
Repository for lab 3

The code in lab_3.ipynb calls the scripts provided in the adversarial-yolo repository.  We kept the code in our lab 3 notebook simple and mostly modified the code that
was provided in the adverarial-yolo repository.  Modified files include load_data.py, test_patch.py (modified file that we used is test_patch3.py), and utils.py
(modified file that we used is utils2.py).  We completed the real world tests for hiding a human and hiding the stop sign in class.  Our patch which is included in the
writeup worked successfully for both experiments.
